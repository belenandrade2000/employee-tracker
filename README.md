## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

As companies grow in revenue, so do their number of employees, roles, managers, and departments. Every part of the business is intigrated with the others. Trying to decipher what employee has what role, who has a manger, and how many departments the company has can be confusing. I built this project to allow a user to input what information they want to know and the code will give them back a table of the requested information. This application is used to manage employee information. Keeping employee information organized and complete can be a difficult task to do by memory or by pen and paper. This application makes it easy to view all company departments, emmployees, and roles each employee can have. This application also allows a user to add a new department, new role, or new employee. Further, this application can also be used to update an employee's information. Through this project, I learned how to better use SELECT statements and overall how to query data.
