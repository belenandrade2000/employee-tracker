# employee-tracker

## Description

As companies grow in revenue, so do their number of employees, roles, managers, and departments. Every part of the business is integrated with the others. Trying to decipher what employee has what role, who has a manger, and how many departments the company has can be confusing. I built this project to allow a user to input what information they want to know and the code will give them back a table of the requested information. This application is used to manage employee information. Keeping employee information organized and complete can be a difficult task to do by memory or by pen and paper. This application makes it easy to view all company departments, employees, and roles each employee can have. This application also allows a user to add a new department, new role, or new employee. Further, this application can also be used to update an employee's information. Through this project, I learned how to better use SELECT statements and overall how to query data.

## Installation

In order to use this application, you will need to have a couple npm libraries such as inquirer, and mysql2. In the terminal, simply write "npm i mysql2", "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" without the quotes. Each line of code should be run separatly.

## Usage

First, navigate to this application file in VS Code. Next, open up the integrated terminal. Once in the terminal, the user should write "node index.js" and press enter. A prompt should appear that asks the user what they want to look at today. The user can use their up and down keys on the keyboard to select the choice they want and press enter. Some choices will ask follow up questions involving inputs or choosing from a list. Once the computer gets all the information it needs, VS Code will present a table of the requested or added information. To view another item, the user can use the up arrow to run "node index.js" again or they can write "node index.js" again in the terminal.
